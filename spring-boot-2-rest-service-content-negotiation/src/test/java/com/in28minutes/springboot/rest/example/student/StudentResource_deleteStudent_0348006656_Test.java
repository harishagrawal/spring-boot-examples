To validate the business logic of the `deleteStudent` function, various test scenarios should be explored. These scenarios will ensure that the system behaves correctly under different conditions. Here are some potential test scenarios:

1. **Successful Deletion**: 
    - **Given** a valid student ID that exists in the student repository,
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called with this ID,
    - **Then** the student should be successfully removed from the repository.

2. **Non-existent Student ID**:
    - **Given** an ID that does not exist in the student repository,
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called with this ID,
    - **Then** the method should handle the situation gracefully, perhaps by throwing a specific exception or returning a particular response to indicate the student was not found.

3. **Invalid Student ID**:
    - **Given** an invalid ID (e.g., negative number, non-numeric),
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called with this ID,
    - **Then** the method should validate the input and return an error or throw an appropriate exception.

4. **Empty Student Repository**:
    - **Given** an empty student repository,
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called with any ID,
    - **Then** the method should handle this case properly, possibly indicating that there are no students to delete.

5. **Delete Student with Dependencies**: 
    - **Given** a student ID that has dependencies (such as enrolled courses, fees, etc.),
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called with this ID,
    - **Then** the response should indicate whether these dependencies are also removed, or if there are restrictions that prevent the deletion.

6. **Concurrent Deletion**:
    - **Given** multiple concurrent requests to delete the same student,
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called simultaneously,
    - **Then** the system should handle concurrency correctly, ensuring that no error occurs due to race conditions.

7. **Deletion Impact on Related Data**:
    - **Given** a student ID that is referenced by other entities (such as exam records, library accounts),
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called with this ID,
    - **Then** the test should confirm whether the deletion cascades to related data or if referential integrity is maintained.

8. **Authorization Checks**:
    - **Given** a user without appropriate permission tries to delete a student,
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called,
    - **Then** the system should deny access and return an unauthorized access error.

9. **Deletion Idempotence**:
    - **Given** a student ID that has been already deleted,
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called with the same ID again,
    - **Then** the method should be idempotent, meaning that the result of the operation should not change and should be handled without errors.

10. **Event Triggers After Deletion**:
    - **Given** a student ID to be deleted,
    - **When** the `deleteStudent` method is called and deletion is successful,
    - **Then** any events or hooks triggered by deletion should execute correctly (e.g., auditing, logging).

Each of these scenarios would need to be transformed into actual test cases in your testing framework of choice. They should include necessary setup (like populating the student repository with test data), invocation of the `deleteStudent` method with specific parameters for each scenario, and assertions that verify that the outcome is as expected.
