/*
To validate the business logic of the `setPassportNumber` method, various test scenarios need to be considered. Since we are concerned only with the test scenarios and not writing any test code, the following scenarios can be defined:

1. **Valid Passport Number:**
   - **Scenario:** Set a valid passport number.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The method should successfully set the passport number.

2. **Invalid Passport Number Format:**
   - **Scenario:** Try setting a passport number that doesn't match the expected format (e.g., length, character types, etc.).
   - **Expected Outcome:** The method should reject the passport number and possibly throw a specific exception or set an error state.

3. **Null Passport Number:**
   - **Scenario:** Try setting the passport number to `null`.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Depending on the business logic, the method should either accept `null` (indicating no passport number), reject it, or throw a `NullPointerException`.

4. **Empty String Passport Number:**
   - **Scenario:** Try setting the passport number to an empty string `""`.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Similar to the null scenario, the method should handle an empty string appropriately based on the predefined business rules.

5. **Passport Number with White Spaces:**
   - **Scenario:** Attempt to set a passport number that contains leading, trailing, or in-between white spaces.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The method should either trim the white spaces and set the passport number, or it should reject it if white space is not allowed.

6. **Passport Number with Special Characters:**
   - **Scenario:** Try setting a passport number that includes special characters (e.g., `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, etc.).
   - **Expected Outcome:** Depending on the rules for valid passport numbers, the method should accept or reject numbers with special characters.

7. **Changing the Passport Number:**
   - **Scenario:** After setting a valid passport number, update it to a new valid passport number.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The passport number should update to the new number without issues.

8. **Concurrent Modifications:**
   - **Scenario:** Simulate simultaneous attempts to set the passport number, potentially in a multi-threaded environment.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The method should handle concurrent access appropriately, avoiding race conditions and ensuring thread safety.

9. **Passport Number With International Characters:**
   - **Scenario:** Provide a passport number with international or non-ASCII characters.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Depending on the system's support for international characters, the method should either save these characters correctly or reject them.

10. **Long Passport Number - Exceeding Length Limitation:**
   - **Scenario:** Provide a passport number that exceeds the expected maximum length.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The method should validate the length of the passport number and either reject the input or truncate it according to the business rules.

11. **Persistence Confirmation:**
   - **Scenario:** After setting the passport number, ensure that it is correctly persisted in the database (if applicable).
   - **Expected Outcome:** The passport number should be retrievable in its set form from the database, confirming successful persistence.

12. **Cross-Field Validation:**
    - **Scenario:** Ensure that setting the passport number does not invalidate the state of other related fields (e.g., country code, nationality, etc.).
    - **Expected Outcome:** Other related fields should maintain their validity after setting or changing the passport number.

Each of these scenarios assumes that the `setPassportNumber` method is part of a larger entity class, potentially impacted by or influencing database persistence and the state of other fields. The tests would help ensure that the method functions as expected in a variety of cases and can handle incorrect or edge-case input gracefully.
