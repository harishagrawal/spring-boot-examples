/*
As a Java programmer tasked with writing test scenarios for the given `StudentNotFoundException`, which is likely an exception tied to a REST API due to the `@ResponseStatus` annotation from Spring, we should first understand the function of this code snippet.

The code defines a custom exception that can be thrown when a particular student is not found in a system, such as a university database or an online course platform. The `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)` annotation indicates that whenever this exception is thrown, the HTTP response should have a status code of 404 (Not Found).

The test scenarios outlined here will test the business logic from multiple aspects without writing any code â€“ we are defining the test cases that should be executed:

**Scenario 1: Student ID Not Found**
1. Attempt to retrieve a student by an ID that does not exist in the system.
2. Validate that the `StudentNotFoundException` is thrown.
3. Validate that the HTTP status code in the response is 404.

**Scenario 2: Student ID Found**
1. Attempt to retrieve a student by an ID that exists in the system.
2. Validate that the `StudentNotFoundException` is *not* thrown.
3. Validate that the HTTP status code is 200 OK or equivalent success code.

**Scenario 3: Invalid Student ID Syntax**
1. Attempt to retrieve a student with an invalid ID syntax (e.g., special characters or format that is not permitted).
2. Validate that the `StudentNotFoundException` or other relevant validation exception is thrown.
3. Validate that the HTTP status code is appropriate for input validation error (e.g., 400 Bad Request).

**Scenario 4: Null or Empty Student ID**
1. Attempt to retrieve a student with a null or empty ID.
2. Validate that the system does not throw `StudentNotFoundException`, but rather a more relevant exception for invalid input (e.g., `IllegalArgumentException`).
3. Validate that the HTTP status code is 400 Bad Request.

**Scenario 5: Edge Cases for Student Retrieval**
1. Attempt to retrieve a student by an ID that represents edge cases such as the lowest or highest possible valid ID, an ID with leading/trailing spaces, or special-case IDs (like a reserved ID).
2. Validate that the behavior of the system is as expected, whether it's throwing `StudentNotFoundException` or not.
3. Confirm the HTTP status code is correct based on whether the student is found or not.

**Scenario 6: Deleting a Student**
1. Delete a student by a valid ID, then attempt to retrieve the same student.
2. Validate that the `StudentNotFoundException` is thrown after deletion.
3. Confirm the HTTP status code is 404.

**Scenario 7: Handle Exception with Additional Context**
1. Throw `StudentNotFoundException` with a specific exception message (e.g., "Student with ID {id} not found").
2. Validate that the response contains the given exception message.
3. Validate that the HTTP status code is still 404.

**Scenario 8: Database Error**
1. Simulate a database error (e.g., connection loss) when attempting to retrieve a student.
2. Validate that `StudentNotFoundException` is *not* thrown (a different exception should be thrown for database errors).
3. Confirm that the system returns a 500 Internal Server Error status code or the appropriate status code for service unavailability (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable).

These scenarios cover a range of cases that ensure the `StudentNotFoundException` and associated business logic are working correctly and are handling errors appropriately in line with REST API principles. The actual test code for these scenarios will need to simulate or manipulate the backend data store, handle mock responses, and catch exceptions as needed.
